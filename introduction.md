## Documentation & Support
Documentation for using the Fornax Science Console are available in 
the [documentation page](https://docs.fornax.sciencecloud.nasa.gov/).
Help and support is available in the [Fornax discource forum](https://discourse.fornax.sciencecloud.nasa.gov).

## Tutorial Notebooks
The `fornax-notebooks` folder in the home directory contains notebooks that are actively being
developed by the Fornax team, a collaboration between NASA's three data archive centers
([HEASARC](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/),
[IRSA](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/frontpage/), and [MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/)).

- **fornax-demo-notebooks**: Tutorial notebooks of fully worked science use cases for all users.
Common goals of the notebooks are the usage of archival data from all NASA archives, cross-archive work,
big data, and computationally intensive science.
These notebooks are also available on
[github](https://github.com/nasa-fornax/fornax-demo-notebooks) and in
[rendered format](https://nasa-fornax.github.io/fornax-demo-notebooks/).

- **irsa-tutorials**: Notebook tutorials that demonstrate access methods and techniques for working with data
served by the [NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive (IRSA)](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/frontpage/).
They cover topics like querying IRSA,
working with catalogs in Parquet format, visualizing with Firefly, and general other techniques.
These notebooks are also available on [github](https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/irsa-tutorials/) 
and in [rendered format](https://caltech-ipac.github.io/irsa-tutorials/).

- **heasarc-tutorials**: Notebook tutorials that demonstrate how find, access and analyze high energy
astrophysics data hosted at the [HEASARC](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/).
They cover archive services as well as mission-specific data analyses.
These notebooks are also available on [github](https://github.com/heasarc/heasarc-tutorials/) 
and in [rendered format](https://heasarc.github.io/heasarc-tutorials/).

- **MAST tutorials**: [MAST]() tutorials are available on [github](https://github.com/spacetelescope/mast_notebooks)
and and in [rendered format](https://spacetelescope.github.io/mast_notebooks/intro.html). A subset of
those notbeooks will be available here soon.

These notebooks and the subsets available on Fornax are updated continuously. If you have question
or to report issues, please use the [Fornax community forum](https://discourse.fornax.sciencecloud.nasa.gov).
