- Optimize by avoiding various image builds if their directories haven't
  changed.

Questions
---------

- What is your process for generating and checking in the conda lockfiles?  I
  suppose it's a run of build.py done locally.  Are we trying to capture the
  state of things after a generic conda update of all packages that's implied
  by conda-env-install's mamba env update?  At what point does it not update
  such that QA can be done? (answer: manual)

- My presumpution about a "release" was that we would generate all of the
  images (base_image, tractor, and heasoft) together, and they would all have
  the same version tag.  Tractor and heasoft would depend on the base image
  with the same version.  This isn't how things work on GitLab currently.
  (answer: use push trigger for dev, release trigger for stable)

- dpkg pkg for Heasoft? (answer: abdu is developing a conda pkg)
